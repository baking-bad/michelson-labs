You can imagine the stack as a game of Jenga: it is a collection of elements that you pile up on top of each other, the goal of \"Michelson Jenga\" being to remove all the pieces except for a specific one that must remain at the end. In order to play, you are given a list of *instructions* that can manipulate the pieces of the game: you can remove them, change their position, add some more on top, check if two pieces are the same to remove them, etc., but one false move and the stack collapses (which we call *failing*).  \n",
