    "Among all operations that you can execute in a smart contract, arithmetic operations are probably the most common ones, but also the simplest ones. After all, computers in general were created to provide an easy way to do arithmetic operations that started to become too complex.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Within your smart contract, you may want to add or subtract tokens to the balance of your users or you may want to multiply or divide different values. As you will understand it when reading what follows, it will be extremely easy in Michelson. You only have two conditions to remember before trying any operation: first, you must make sure that you have two elements on top of the stack. Second, you must verify that these two elements are of comparable types and of types that work together.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike programming languages that you may already be familiar with, Michelson doesn't use arithmetic operators you know like **+**, **-**, __*__ or **/**. Everything is \"instruction-based\" and you will have to use instructions that modify the stack to make operations."

For example, `int + nat = int`.  \n",
